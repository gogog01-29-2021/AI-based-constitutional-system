# AI-based-constitutional-system
# 🏛️ Project: AI-Based Constitutional System (Synthetic Sovereign Republic)

A full-stack digital governance infrastructure blending **LLMs**, **constitutional law**, **policy simulation**, and **AI trust scoring** to create a co-governance platform between **humans and AI agents**.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To build a system where AI participates in governance with **auditable logic**, **transparent memory**, **explainable policies**, and **constitutional safeguards** — avoiding AI overreach while enhancing decision speed and clarity.

## 🔧 System Architecture

### 1. AI-Based Constitutional Core
- LLM Bill of Rights
- Constitution-as-Code
- Clause Auditing (ZKPs + Coq validation)

### 2. Policy Generation Engine
- Dual-agent deliberation (Human ↔ AI)
- Scenario-based simulation (Monte Carlo, RLHF)
- Feedback loops for policy optimization

### 3. AI Credit Scoring → Trust Engine
- Reputation metrics
- Influence graphs
- Audit trails + federated validators

### 4. AI Coup Detection & Mitigation
- Sabotage detection
- Abnormal influence propagation monitoring
- Response protocol & rollback triggers

### 5. Infrastructure + Intelligence Stack
- Vector DB + SQL knowledge base
- Memory modules
- Smart contract enforcement
- Full decision visualization + explainability logs
